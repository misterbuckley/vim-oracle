# TODO
------
- [ ] Add a command to select from history items. I want to have a window like ctrl-P where I can fuzzy search past conversations and current open chats. Ideally, I should be able to continue each conversation as if I were using the web interface for an AI.
- [ ] Add a key mapping that brings up the ai window like ctrl-P brings up the search window.
- [ ] Add a key mapping that brings up a list of previous and current conversations, like ctrl-P does.



- FIX visual mode


# Done
